This is an 8th Project I've prepared after finishing the "100 days of code" course.

This is an app that lets the user register, login and create their own lists with tasks TODO.
I used FlaskLogin to create a login manager , Flask Bootstrap5 for the app, werkzeug.security to hash the password of the user, 
forms for RegisterForm, LoginForm and SQLAlchemy to save the data for users/lists/tasks in db file.

Feel free to give me tips on the code, I welcome any suggestions!
